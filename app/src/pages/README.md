# `pages` Folder

This folder contains all the pages that will be part of the application. Details on required numbers will be provided in the Phase 3 documentation.

These pages are meant to show you an example of some of the features of Streamlit and the way we will limit functionality access by role/persona. It is not meant to represent a complete application.

NOTE: After you delete a question/user/peer-interview, IT WILL BE DELETED FROM THE DATABASE and will not show up again until you restart the database. (this was what happened in our presentation video where John's peer-interview sessions returned empty. You can go there again and see it is not actually empty)

Also, company ID input fields will only allow integers from 1-40, as we populated 40 companies only.
