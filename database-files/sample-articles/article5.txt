The program, running from June through August, features a diverse lineup, including live theater productions, music concerts, art exhibits, and hands-on workshops for all age groups. Highlights include a weeklong Shakespeare festival, a showcase of emerging local bands, and a family-friendly art camp designed to inspire budding young artists.  

“This summer, we aim to transform the Strand into a hub of artistic expression,” said artistic director Samuel Greene. “Our goal is to provide opportunities for local talent to shine while offering the community enriching cultural experiences.”  

A centerpiece of the program is the “Spotlight on Local Talent” series, which will feature performances and exhibits exclusively by artists from the region. “This is our way of giving back to the community that has supported us for decades,” Greene added.

The Strand’s summer program also includes partnerships with local schools and community organizations to ensure accessibility. Scholarships and free ticket programs are available for students and families in need, reinforcing the theater’s commitment to inclusivity.  

Longtime patrons of the theater are thrilled about the upcoming season. “The Strand has always been a place where the arts come alive,” said resident Maria Lopez. “This program is a wonderful way to keep that tradition going.”  

Tickets and schedules for the summer arts program will be released later this month, with early-bird discounts available for season passes. The Strand encourages all art lovers, performers, and curious newcomers to join in celebrating the vibrant creativity of the community this summer.
