“We want to be more than just a restaurant,” said James Peters. “Our goal is to create a space where people can connect over great food and learn more about where it comes from.”  

With the opening of its second location, Harvest Table is poised to solidify its reputation as a leader in sustainable dining. Community members and visitors alike are encouraged to stop by and discover the flavors that have made the restaurant a local favorite.
